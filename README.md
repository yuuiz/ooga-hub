## ooga hub

### Our hub is currently the only hub that is currently working in rake kill test!
### Most hub doesnt even have support or just discontinued, and some others doesn't have our features.
### Since our hub isn't that popular, most exploiters in rake kill test use inf yield, or some crappy old hub
## rake kill test
### The game's anticheat is so bad, that even a skid could bypass it.
### The game's old shop is clientsided, we had inf money feature coded and also get all tools
### In the new update, the shop wasn't even loadingðŸ¤¡
### They mostly fixed all the issues with the shop tho
### Our old anticheat bypasser somehow stills works, the anticheat isn't even updated since 2022
### After looking at the anticheat script at 2023 and compare it to the 2022 version, it was exactly THE SAME
### Our Infinite Stamina Exploit still works for some reason, the tools still works with the exploit
### They mostly fixed the overpowered exploit. They didn't fix some like anticheat bypass, inf stamina
